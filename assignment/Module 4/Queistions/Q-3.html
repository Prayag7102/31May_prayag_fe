    <p class="q3">Q.3 What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3 ?</p>
    <p>
      CSS3 is an enhanced version of CSS that introduced several new features
      and improvements over CSS2. Some of the key differences include:
    </p>

    <div>
      1. Selectors:- <br />
      <span
        >CSS3 introduced new and more powerful selectors that allow developers
        to target specific elements more precisely. Selectors like attribute
        selectors, nth-child, and :not() were added in CSS3.</span
      >
    </div>
    <div>
      2. Flexbox and Grid:- <br />
      <span
        >CSS3 introduced flexible box (flexbox) and grid layout systems, which
        significantly enhance the control and ease of creating complex layouts
        compared to the limitations of CSS2</span
      >
    </div>
    <div>
      3. Multiple Backgrounds:- <br />
      <span
        >CSS3 allows for the use of multiple background images on an element,
        giving designers more flexibility in creating visually rich
        layouts.</span
      >
    </div>
    <div>
      4. Custom Fonts:- <br />
      <span
        >CSS3 introduced @font-face, enabling the use of custom fonts on
        websites, expanding typographic possibilities beyond the standard
        web-safe fonts available in CSS2.</span
      >
    </div>
    <div>
       5. Transforms and Transitions:- <br />
      <span> CSS3 introduced properties like transform and transition, allowing developers to perform various transformations (such as rotations, scaling, skewing) and create smooth transitions between CSS property values.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
       6. Text Effects:- <br />
      <span>CSS3 includes properties for text effects, such as text-shadow, which enables the creation of shadow effects around text, and text-overflow, allowing for better control over text when it overflows its container.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
       7. Animations and Transitions:-   <br>
     <span>CSS3 brought inbuilt support for animations and transitions, allowing developers to create dynamic and engaging effects without relying on JavaScript. </span>
    </div>
