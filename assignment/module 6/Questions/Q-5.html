      Undeclared Variables: <br />
      <span
        >These are variables that haven't been declared using var, let, or const
        before being used in the code. When you attempt to access a variable
        that hasn't been declared, you'll typically encounter a reference
        error.</span

    </div>
    <div>
        Undefined Variables:  <br>
        <span>These are variables that have been declared but not assigned a value explicitly. In JavaScript, when you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, the variable holds the value undefined by default until a value is assigned to it.</span>
