    <div class="intro">
      jQuery is a popular, lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify
      the client-side scripting of HTML. It was created to ease the complexities
      of JavaScript and to make it easier to navigate and manipulate HTML
      documents, handle events, perform animations, and simplify AJAX
      interactions.
