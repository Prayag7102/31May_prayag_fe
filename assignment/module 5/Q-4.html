    <p>
        The &lt;canvas&gt; and &lt;svg&gt; tags are both used for creating graphics within HTML documents, but they differ in their approach, functionality, and how they're utilized.</p>
    <div>
        &lt;canvas&gt; Tag:
            The &lt;canvas&gt; <br>
        <span>tag provides a drawing surface using JavaScript, allowing you to create dynamic, scriptable rendering of graphics, animations, and interactive content.With &lt;canvas&gt;, you have a pixel-based drawing surface that can be manipulated dynamically through JavaScript. It's great for animations, games, and interactive visualizations.</span>
    </div>

    <div>
        &lt;svg&gt; Tag:
            <br>
        <span> SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and is XML-based. It defines vector-based graphics in XML format, which means the graphics are scalable without loss of quality.SVG graphics are defined using shapes, paths, text, and other graphic elements directly within the HTML code. It's excellent for static or interactive graphics that need to scale smoothly across various screen sizes. </span>
