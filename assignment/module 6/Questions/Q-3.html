    <div>In JavaScript, Negative Infinity is a special value representing the mathematical concept of negative infinity. It's the value that is smaller than any other number (including negative numbers) and can be obtained using Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY or simply by evaluating -(1/0). <br><br>
        <div>Negative Infinity is often used in computations to represent scenarios where a value tends towards negative infinity or as a boundary case in mathematical operations. When used in arithmetic operations, any finite number subtracted from -Infinity still results in -Infinity.</div>
