      Q.16 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style
      sheets?
    </p>

    <h1>Advantages:</h1>

    <div>
        Reusability: <br />
      <span>Styles defined in an external CSS file can be applied across multiple HTML files, ensuring consistency in design throughout a website.</span>
    </div>

    <div>
        Maintenance: <br />
      <span>Centralizing styles in a separate file makes it easier to manage and update styles universally without the need to modify each HTML file individually.</span>
    </div>

    <div>
      Faster Loading: <br />
      <span>External CSS files can be cached by the browser after the initial visit, resulting in quicker loading times for subsequent visits to pages that use the same stylesheet.</span>
    </div>
    <h1>Disadvantages:</h1>

    <div>
     Network Dependency: <br />
      <span> If the external stylesheet fails to load due to network issues or errors, it can affect the appearance and layout of the web page.</span>
    </div>

    <div>
        Increased HTTP Requests:  <br />
      <span>Loading external stylesheets requires an additional HTTP request, which might marginally increase the webpage's loading time, especially if there are multiple stylesheets.</span>
    </div>
  </body>
