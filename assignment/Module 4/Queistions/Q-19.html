    <p>
      A rule set in CSS consists of one or more declarations that define the
      styling properties to be applied to specific HTML elements selected by a
      selector. It's a fundamental structure in CSS used to apply styles to
      elements on a webpage.
    </p>
    <div>
      Selector:

      <br />
      <span>
        It defines the HTML elements to which the styles will be applied. It
        could be an element name, class, ID, or a combination of these, among
        other selectors.</span
      >
    </div>
    <div>
      Rule sets in CSS allow developers to apply styles across HTML elements by
      associating specific styling properties  with
      elements targeted by selectors. This forms the core structure for creating
      visually appealing and consistent designs on web pages.
