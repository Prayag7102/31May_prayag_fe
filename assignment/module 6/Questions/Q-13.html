    <p class="q13">Q.13 What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</p>

    <div style="color: black;">
        Using innerHTML in JavaScript offers convenience for manipulating HTML content within an element, but it also comes with some disadvantages:</div>

     <div>
        Security Risks:<br>
        <span> If the content assigned to innerHTML is not properly sanitized, it could contain malicious scripts that, when executed, might lead to security vulnerabilities.</span>
     </div>   

     <div>
        Performance Overheads: <br>
        <span> When innerHTML is used to modify a portion of the DOM, the browser needs to reparse and re-render the entire content within that element, which can be inefficient compared to targeted DOM manipulation using other methods.</span>
     </div>

     <div>
        Event Listener Removal:  <br>
        <span>When setting innerHTML to replace HTML content, any event listeners attached directly to elements within that content will be lost. You'd need to reattach the event listeners after setting innerHTML.</span>
     </div>

     <div>
        Loss of Data and State: <br>
        <span>If you overwrite HTML using innerHTML, any references or data stored in existing DOM elements will be lost unless they are reassigned or preserved.</span>
     </div>
