    <p class="q7">Q.7 What is === operator? </p>

    <div>
        The === operator, known as the "strong equas to operator," is used in JavaScript for comparison. It checks for equality between two values while also checking if their types are the same.
    </div>
    <h1>Example:</h1>
    <div style="color: brown;">
        5 === 5 evaluates to true because both operands are of the same value (5) and type (number). <br>
        5 === '5' evaluates to false because even though the values are the same, their types (number and string) are different.
    </div>
  </body>
