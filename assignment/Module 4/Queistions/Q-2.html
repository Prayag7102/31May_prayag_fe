    <div>
      1. Connected to HTML:- <br />
      <span
        >If you change the structure of your website, you might have to tweak
        your CSS too. It's like a matching outfit - if you change one piece, you
        might need to adjust the others to keep everything looking good
        together.</span
      >
    </div>
    <div>
      2. Layout Control:- <br />
      <span
        >Sometimes, especially with older browsers or specific layout needs, CSS
        might not give you all the control you want. It can be a bit limiting in
        certain situations.</span
      >
    </div>
    <div>
      3. Browser Compatibility: <br />
      <span
        >Sometimes, what looks great in one browser might appear wonky in
        another. Making sure your site looks good across all browsers can be a
        bit of a headache.</span
      >
    </div>
    <div>
      4.  Tricky Complex Designs:-<br />
      <span> If you're going for a super fancy layout or design, CSS might not always make it easy. You might need some workarounds or clever tricks to get things looking just right.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      5.  Dynamic Limits:-  <br />
      <span>CSS is great for styling, but it's not as good at making really interactive or dynamic stuff like JavaScript can. Sometimes it falls a bit short in that department.</span>
